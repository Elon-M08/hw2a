/**
 * The Board class represents a 5x5 game board used in the game Santorini, containing
 * functionality for managing tower heights, worker positions, and movements. Each 
 * field on the board is tracked for its tower height and whether it is occupied by a 
 * worker or dome. This class provides methods to build towers, check for valid moves, 
 * place workers, and move them according to the rules of the game.
 *
 * Fields:
 * - `grid` (int[][]): A 5x5 grid representing the tower height at each position. 
 *   Heights range from 0 (empty) to 3 (maximum tower height), with 4 indicating a dome.
 * - `workers` (Worker[][]): A 5x5 grid representing the presence of workers. Each 
 *   position is either null (no worker) or contains a Worker object.
 *
 * Key Methods:
 * - `isOccupied(int x, int y)`: Checks if a field is occupied by a worker or a dome.
 * - `getTowerHeight(int x, int y)`: Returns the current height of the tower at a given field.
 * - `build(int x, int y)`: Builds a block or dome on an unoccupied field, up to a max 
 *   height of 3, then adds a dome.
 * - `isValidMove(int fromX, int fromY, int toX, int toY)`: Checks if a move from one 
 *   field to an adjacent field is valid according to adjacency and height rules.
 * - `placeWorker(int x, int y, Worker worker)`: Places a worker on the board if the field 
 *   is unoccupied.
 * - `moveWorker(int fromX, int fromY, int toX, int toY)`: Moves a worker from one position 
 *   to another if the move is valid.
 *
 * This class ensures game rules are enforced for tower building, worker placement, and 
 * movement, enabling core gameplay mechanics of the Santorini board.
