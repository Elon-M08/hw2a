/**
 * The Worker class represents a worker piece in the game, associated with a player and 
 * positioned on the game board.
 *
 * Each worker has:
 * - A position on the board (`x` and `y` coordinates) that tracks its current location.
 * - An `owner`, represented by a `Player` object, which indicates the player controlling 
 *   this worker.
 *
 * Key Methods:
 * - `move(int newX, int newY, Board board)`: Attempts to move the worker to a new 
 *   position on the board, verifying the move is valid according to the game rules.
 * - `getX()` and `getY()`: Return the worker's current coordinates.
 * - `getOwner()`: Returns the player who owns the worker.
 *
 * This class encapsulates the worker's movement and state management, allowing 
 * for interaction with the game board and enforcing player ownership of each worker.
